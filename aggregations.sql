-- Table: Cinema

-- +----------------+----------+
-- | Column Name    | Type     |
-- +----------------+----------+
-- | id             | int      |
-- | movie          | varchar  |
-- | description    | varchar  |
-- | rating         | float    |
-- +----------------+----------+
-- id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
-- rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
 

-- Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".

-- Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

Select *
FROM Cinema c 
Where c.id % 2 <> 0 and c.description <>'boring'
order by rating desc;

-- Table: Prices

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | product_id    | int     |
-- | start_date    | date    |
-- | end_date      | date    |
-- | price         | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- (product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
-- For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
 

-- Table: UnitsSold

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | product_id    | int     |
-- | purchase_date | date    |
-- | units         | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- This table may contain duplicate rows.
-- Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
 

-- Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.

-- Return the result table in any order.
